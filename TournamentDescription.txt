Describe your tournament design here. Please don't write more than 250 words.

The tournament follows a structure akin to the FIFA World Cup, consisting of a group stage followed by knockout rounds.
Matches are decided based on the overall skill level of the teams, a calculated metric encompassing player and manager skills.
The knockout stage involves a series of single-elimination rounds: the Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and the Final.
Like in the group stage, matches are determined by comparing the overall skill levels of the competing teams.
